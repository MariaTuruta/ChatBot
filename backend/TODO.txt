+- Implement the code flow created by Anna
~ Prepare the chatbot for the second atestation :
 ~ Finish the function handling the statements :
  + Return true if the statement is found in the db
  + If not, find other statements in the database with the same subject and relation
  + If none of the objects (complements?) in the statements from the db is 'the same' as the one in the received statement, learn it :
   + Implement the function comparing objects (should be same same if they have the same relation with the same object, as subjects, ex: 'Sur e culoare' is the same as 'Albastru e culoare')
  + Else say that the statement is false and output the one that found in the db
 + Finish the function handling the questions :
  - If there is nothing to replace, it should work as a verifier, the as with statements (didn't do, because I already do that with '.')
  + Handle '_' instead of relations, not just subject and objects
 + Finish the function handling the corrections :
  + Implement the same the as with the statements, to ensure that the right row in the db is overwritten
 - Handle arrays for the questions in the frontend
- (Optional) Figure out how to implement the communication with websockets
